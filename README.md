# prusa2mqtt MK4

I recently purchased a Prusa MK4 3D Printer.  Unfortunately, the official home-assistant integration is not compatible with my printer <https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/prusalink>.  This project is a quick attempt to get data I needed into a MQTT server, to be ingested by home-assistant.

## Project Description

The purpose of this project is to provide a streamlined method for transferring Prusalink data to an MQTT server. By leveraging Python and Docker, this solution offers a straightforward and efficient approach to seamlessly handle data transmission.

## Supported / Tested / Required Prusalink Version
    api: 2.0.0
    server: 2.1.2


## Features

* Simplified Prusalink data integration with an MQTT server.
* Python-based implementation for flexibility and ease of use.
* Docker containerization for effortless deployment and scalability.

## Usage
Open the ".env" file using a text editor of your choice.
Look for the lines in the ".env" file that correspond to your MQTT and PrusaLink servers. 

file:  .env
    
    APP_VERSION="1.0" # Do Not Change
    MQTT_HOST="192.168.0.10"
    MQTT_PORT=1883
    MQTT_USER="mqtt-password" 
    MQTT_PASS="mqtt-password"
    PRUSALINK_HOST="http://192.168.0.20"
    PRUSALINK_USER="maker"
    PRUSALINK_PASS="password"
    PRUSALINK_CALLS="info,version,status" # Do Not Change
    PRUSALINK_UPDATE=30 $ Update Frequency

After you have edited your .env file, run the following commands.

    $ git clone <project>
    $ cd <project>
    $ docker-compose up -d && docker-compose logs -f
    
If all goes well, you'll see something like this populating your mqtt server:

I then used this document to manuallly import the MQTT topics into Home Assistant.
